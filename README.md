# imdb-search-data

The app developed on the requirements

Use IMDB Dataset in order to develop these functionalities using Java 8+ and expose proper RESTful HTTP APIs : 

1. Import the dataset into the application
2. Return all the titles in which both director and writer are the same person and he/she is still alive
3. Get two actors and return all the titles in which both of them played at
4. Get a genre from the user and return best titles on each year for that genre based on number of votes and rating
5. Count how many HTTP requests you received in this application since the last startup 

Considerations: 
  ●  You Don’t have to use any external database application but if you want to just use them in in-memory mode, your application should run standalone
  ●  You are free to use any web framework you like but if you choose anything other than Spring Boot you need to explain why
  ●  Do not implement any UI

Note : Datasets files size is big and then not uploaded the repository. go to the link (https://developer.imdb.com/non-commercial-datasets/) download the files and create datasets folder 
      under resources folder and import the files there
